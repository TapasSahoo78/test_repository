To automatically update the fare when the user inputs pickup and drop locations in each tab, and then display the fare dynamically, you'll need to make a few adjustments to your existing code. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Attach Event Listeners**: Attach event listeners to the pickup and drop location input fields in each tab. These event listeners will trigger the calculation of the fare whenever the user inputs new locations.

2. **Calculate Fare Dynamically**: Update the `calculatePrice()` function to calculate the fare dynamically based on the distance between the pickup and drop locations.

3. **Display Fare**: After calculating the fare, update the fare view dynamically to show the calculated fare.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
function initialize() {
    const tabs = document.querySelectorAll('.tab-pane');

    tabs.forEach((tab, index) => {
        const pickupInput = tab.querySelector('.pickupLocation');
        const dropInput = tab.querySelector('.dropLocation');

        // Attach event listeners to pickup and drop location input fields
        pickupInput.addEventListener('input', calculatePrice);
        dropInput.addEventListener('input', calculatePrice);
    });
}

function calculatePrice() {
    const tab = this.closest('.tab-pane');
    const pickupInput = tab.querySelector('.pickupLocation');
    const dropInput = tab.querySelector('.dropLocation');
    const fareView = tab.querySelector('.fare');

    const pickup = pickupInput.value;
    const drop = dropInput.value;

    // Call a function to calculate distance between pickup and drop locations
    const distance = calculateDistance(pickup, drop);

    // Calculate fare based on distance
    const fare = calculateFare(distance);

    // Update the fare view with the calculated fare
    fareView.innerText = fare.toFixed(2); // Display fare with two decimal places
}

// Rest of the code remains the same as before...
```

In your HTML code, make sure you have a `fare` element within each tab where you want to display the dynamically calculated fare:

```html
<!-- Fare view -->
<div class="fare"></div>
```

With these modifications, the fare will be automatically updated and displayed whenever the user inputs new pickup and drop locations in each tab. Make sure your HTML structure remains intact with appropriate classes assigned to pickup and drop location input fields and the fare display element within each tab.
