The error you're encountering indicates that the `razorpay_payment_id` is not being passed correctly to the controller method `payment(Request $request)`. 

In the Razorpay handler function, ensure that you include the `razorpay_payment_id` in the form data before submitting it. Here's how you can modify the handler function to include the payment ID:

```javascript
handler: function(response) {
    // Handle the response from Razorpay
    console.log(response);

    // Add the payment ID to the form data
    const paymentIdInput = document.createElement('input');
    paymentIdInput.type = 'hidden';
    paymentIdInput.name = 'razorpay_payment_id';
    paymentIdInput.value = response.razorpay_payment_id;

    // Append the payment ID input to the form
    form.appendChild(paymentIdInput);

    // Submit the form after payment completion
    form.submit();
}
```

With this modification, the `razorpay_payment_id` will be included in the form data when it is submitted, allowing your controller method to retrieve it correctly.

Please update your Razorpay handler function accordingly and test the payment flow again to ensure that the `razorpay_payment_id` is passed correctly to your Laravel controller method.
