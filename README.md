Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to urgently request VPN access to our office network. This is essential for me to continue working on the SFT project from home, as there are critical tasks that require immediate attention.

Your prompt assistance in setting this up would be greatly appreciated, as it will enable me to maintain project timelines and ensure the smooth progress of our work.

Please let me know the steps I need to follow to gain access.

Thank you for your support.
