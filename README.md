To calculate the distance between the pickup and drop locations using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API and then multiply it by 5 to get the fare per kilometer, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Google Maps Distance Matrix API**: Ensure that you have access to the Google Maps Distance Matrix API and have obtained an API key.

2. **Make API Request**: Use JavaScript to make a request to the Distance Matrix API, providing the pickup and drop locations as origins and destinations, respectively.

3. **Parse Response**: Parse the response from the API to extract the distance between the locations.

4. **Calculate Fare**: Multiply the distance by 5 to get the fare per kilometer.

Here's how you can implement this in your code:

```javascript
function calculatePrice() {
    const tab = this.closest('.tab-pane');
    const pickupInput = tab.querySelector('.pickupLocation');
    const dropInput = tab.querySelector('.dropLocation');
    const fareView = tab.querySelector('.fare');

    const pickup = pickupInput.value;
    const drop = dropInput.value;

    // Check if both pickup and drop locations are entered
    if (pickup && drop) {
        // Make API request to Google Maps Distance Matrix API
        const service = new google.maps.DistanceMatrixService();
        service.getDistanceMatrix({
            origins: [pickup],
            destinations: [drop],
            travelMode: 'DRIVING',
            unitSystem: google.maps.UnitSystem.METRIC,
            avoidHighways: false,
            avoidTolls: false,
        }, (response, status) => {
            if (status === 'OK') {
                const distance = response.rows[0].elements[0].distance.value; // Distance in meters
                const distanceInKm = distance / 1000; // Convert meters to kilometers
                const fare = distanceInKm * 5; // Fare calculation: 5 currency units per kilometer
                fareView.innerText = fare.toFixed(2); // Update the fare view with the calculated fare
            } else {
                console.error('Error:', status);
                fareView.innerText = ''; // Clear fare view if there's an error
            }
        });
    } else {
        fareView.innerText = ''; // Clear fare view if either pickup or drop location is missing
    }
}
```

In this code:

- The `calculatePrice()` function now makes an asynchronous request to the Google Maps Distance Matrix API to obtain the distance between the pickup and drop locations.
- The response is parsed to extract the distance in meters, which is then converted to kilometers.
- The fare is calculated by multiplying the distance by 5 (assuming 5 currency units per kilometer).
- The fare is then displayed in the fare view element.

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual Google Maps API key in the HTML file where you load the Maps JavaScript API. Additionally, ensure that you have included the Google Maps JavaScript API script tag in your HTML file.
