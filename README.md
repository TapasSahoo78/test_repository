To conditionally apply green or red color based on the `mode` attribute in your Laravel blade template, you can use inline conditional statements along with inline styles or CSS classes. Here's how you can achieve this:

```html
<h5 style="color: {{ $history->mode == 'credited' ? 'green' : 'red' }}">{{ $history->mode == 'credited' ? '+' : '-' }} {{ $history->amount }}</h5>
```

In this code:
- The `style` attribute is used to apply inline CSS to the `<h5>` element.
- The inline conditional statement `{{ $history->mode == 'credited' ? 'green' : 'red' }}` determines the color based on the value of the `mode` attribute. If `mode` is `'credited'`, it applies the color green; otherwise, it applies the color red.
- Inside the `<h5>` element, another inline conditional statement `{{ $history->mode == 'credited' ? '+' : '-' }}` is used to display either `+` or `-` based on the value of the `mode` attribute.

This will render the `<h5>` element with green color and a `+` sign if the `mode` attribute is `'credited'`, and with red color and a `-` sign if the `mode` attribute is not `'credited'`. Adjust the styles or classes as needed to match your application's design requirements.
