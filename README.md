Admin Panel:
1.The Timetable Management should match the tables in the Bus Stop Management (and not all the bus stops combined in a single table)
2.In the Timetable Management, besides time, it needs to be added the day of the week, as the the timetable is different every day of the week.
3.the timetable for the current day needs to be available to drivers and customers as well.
4.the driver and customers interfaces to have a button, Timetable, where to see the timetable of the current day by default and the timetable for the other day to be like a drop down menu, if they want to see the timetable of another day.
5.if one route needed to be adjusted, it's important to have only the bus stop for that route in the table.
6.The bus stops need to be grouped together by the same route, we can't have all the bus stops for all routes together, because they can't be managed.
