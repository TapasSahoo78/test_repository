It appears that the issue is related to how the value is being retrieved from the input field. When using `.value` to retrieve the value of an input field, it only returns the value that has been explicitly set using JavaScript or entered by the user.

In the case of an autocomplete or suggestion feature provided by Google Places Autocomplete, the selected value might not be directly assigned to the input's value attribute. Instead, it might be stored elsewhere, such as in a hidden input field or in the DOM as plain text.

To address this issue, you can try accessing the value stored by Google Places Autocomplete directly from the DOM element where it's stored. Here's how you can modify your code to retrieve the selected value from the autocomplete suggestion:

```javascript
// Retrieve the selected value from the DOM element where Google Places Autocomplete stores it
const dropValue = dropInput.getAttribute('aria-label') || dropInput.value;
console.log('Drop Value:', dropValue);
```

In this modified code:

- `getAttribute('aria-label')` attempts to retrieve the value stored in the `aria-label` attribute, which is commonly used by Google Places Autocomplete to store the selected value.
- If `aria-label` is not present or empty, it falls back to retrieving the value using `.value`.

This approach should ensure that you retrieve the full selected value, including any spaces or special characters, from the Google Places Autocomplete suggestion. Try using this modified code to see if it resolves the issue with the truncated drop value.
