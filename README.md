Subject: Request for VPN Access

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request VPN access to our office network. This access will enable me to [briefly explain why you need VPN access, e.g., "work remotely more efficiently" or "access necessary files and systems securely from home"].

Please let me know the necessary steps or information required to set up this access. I appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Best regards,

[Your Full Name]  
[Your Position]  
[Your Contact Information]
