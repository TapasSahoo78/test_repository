Here's a corrected and more structured version of your requirements:

B2B Fare Calculation:

The hourly price should be set as a single field.

If the distance matches with the master data, the fare will be set according to the predefined distance price.

If the distance doesn't match, calculate the fare by multiplying the extra kilometers with the hourly rate.


Driver Payout:

Review and discuss the driver payout based on the B2C payout history for consistency and adjustments.


Let me know if this captures what you intended or if further adjustments are needed!
