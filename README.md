Sure, if you're facing issues with the `has()` method not working as expected, you can try to debug the issue by simplifying the query and checking each step. Here's how you can approach it:

```php
// First, make sure your relationships are correctly defined in your model classes.

// Then, simplify your query to identify any potential issues:

$query = SELF_MODEL::with([
    'user' => function ($q) {
        $q->select('id', 'user_type');
    },
    'bulkBookingDriver' => function ($q) {
        $q->where('driver_id', Auth::id());
    }
])->whereNotNull('bulk_driver')
  ->whereDate('booking_date', $request['booking_date'])
  ->latest();

// Execute the query without pagination to see if the `has()` constraint works as expected:
$results = $query->get();

// Check if the `bulkBookingDriver` relationship is loaded for each result:
foreach ($results as $result) {
    if ($result->bulkBookingDriver->isNotEmpty()) {
        // Relationship is loaded with data
        // You can do something here if needed
    } else {
        // Relationship is empty
        // You may want to handle this case accordingly
    }
}

// If the above loop works as expected, you can proceed with pagination:
$list = $query->has('bulkBookingDriver')->paginate(20);

// Return the paginated list
return $list;
```

This code will help you debug by checking if the `bulkBookingDriver` relationship is loaded correctly for each result. If it's not working as expected, you might need to revisit your model relationships or the data in your database. If everything works fine, then the issue might lie in the pagination or how you're handling the paginated results.
