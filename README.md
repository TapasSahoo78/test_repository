Dear Sir/Ma'am,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide clarification and justification for the recent leaves I have taken from work due to personal reasons. I deeply apologize for any inconvenience my absence may have caused and appreciate your understanding during this time.

I understand the importance of consistent attendance and my role in the team's operations. I assure you that I am committed to minimizing any disruption caused by my absence. I have been actively working to delegate tasks, provide necessary instructions, and maintain communication with my colleagues to ensure continuity in our projects.

Total leaves from previous 3 months -

Thank you once again for your patience and consideration.
