The "Invalid amount" error typically occurs when there is an issue with the format or value of the amount being passed to the Razorpay API. Here's how you can troubleshoot and fix the issue:

1. **Ensure Correct Amount Format**: Make sure that the amount passed to the Razorpay API is in the correct format. Razorpay expects the amount to be in paisa (the smallest currency unit), so multiply the entered amount by 100 to convert it to paisa.

2. **Check Input Field**: Ensure that the input field (`razorpayAmount`) is correctly capturing the recharge amount entered by the user. You can log the value of `amountInput.value` to the console to verify its value.

3. **Handle Empty or Non-Numeric Values**: Handle cases where the entered amount is empty or non-numeric to prevent errors. You can add validation logic to ensure that the entered value is a valid number before attempting to calculate the amount in paisa.

4. **Verify Razorpay API Key**: Double-check that you are using the correct Razorpay API key (`rzp_test_l5IvNZuMCyyln6`) and that it is configured properly in your application.

5. **Debugging**: Use browser developer tools to inspect the network requests and responses when submitting the payment form. This can help identify any issues with the data being sent to Razorpay.

Here's an updated version of the JavaScript code with added error handling and logging to help diagnose the issue:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    const amountInput = document.getElementById('razorpayAmount');
    const razorpayScript = document.querySelector('script[data-key="rzp_test_l5IvNZuMCyyln6"]');

    amountInput.addEventListener('input', function () {
        const amountValue = parseFloat(amountInput.value.trim());
        
        if (!isNaN(amountValue) && amountValue > 0) {
            const amountInPaisa = Math.round(amountValue * 100); // Convert to paisa
            razorpayScript.setAttribute('data-amount', amountInPaisa);
        } else {
            console.error('Invalid amount entered.');
        }
    });
});
```

With this code, you'll get more insights into the issue, and it will help you pinpoint where the problem lies. If you continue to encounter the "Invalid amount" error, consider reviewing the Razorpay documentation or reaching out to their support for further assistance.
